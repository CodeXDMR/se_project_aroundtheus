1. Additional whitespace between the bottom of each photo and its description was detected. This was eliminated using **_vertical-align: text-bottom;_**.

2. A double border was encountered on one of the buttons. The svg image was not exported properly from Figma. A flattened version of the button which included the outline and plus sign was exported instead of just the plus sign.
